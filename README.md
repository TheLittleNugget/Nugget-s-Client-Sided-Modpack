# Nugget-s-Client-Sided-Modpack
Hello, here I present a modpack fully set for client side. This modpack just adds a ton of features to make vanilla a lot better. Adding cool mods that give a cool better feel and/or just new way to experience things in vanilla.
Only added mods will be client side and tested to see if they work together.
Resource packs that also give a better feel and more experience to the game along side shaderpacks as well.
